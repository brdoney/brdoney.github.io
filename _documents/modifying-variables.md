# Manipulating Variables

In Java, there are a couple of ways we can change variables after we have created them. In the following table, the variable declared below is used.

```java
int myVar = 1;
```

| Action | Example      | English                                    |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `=`    | `myVar=3;`   | Make myVar 3                               |
| `+=`   | `myVar+=14;` | Add 14 to the current value of myVar       |
| `++`   | `myVar++;`   | Add 1 to the current value of myVar        |
| `-=`   | `myVar-=9;`  | Subtract 9 from the current value of myVar |
| `--`   | `myVar--;`   | Subtract 1 from the current value of myVar |
| `*=`   | `myVar*=4;`  | Multiply the current value of myVar by two |
| `/=`   | `myVar/= 7;` | Divide the current value of myVar by 7     |

We've created a ton of variables while working with Java, but we haven't talked much about how to change them. Changing a variable is important because it allows us to...

- Do quick math with variables
- Store values that change over time, like active users or health points in a game
- Write powerful conditionals
