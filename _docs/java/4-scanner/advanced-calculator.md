title: Making the Calculator Interactive
order: 7
type: exercise

So, we've made a calculator that uses values of variables that we wrote into the code, but let's make our program more useful by asking for user input instead.

## Outline

1. Ask the user for the first value for your program to use
2. As the user for the second value for your program to use
3. Print the result of doing some mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to the first and second value

## Example Output

**Lines with `>` at the beginning mean the text on the line was input for the program**

For this example, I'm simply using addition:

```rawtext
> 3
> 4
7
```

## More Ideas

- Ask the user what they would like to do...

    ```rawtext
    1) Add
    2) Subtract
    3) Multiply
    4) Divide
    ```

    And based on their answer, change what you do with the two variables.
