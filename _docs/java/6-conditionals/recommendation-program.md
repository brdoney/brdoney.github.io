title: Recommendation Program
order: 11
type: exercise

There's a lot of movies to watch, videos to enjoy, and games to play. So let's help people out and create a short program that gives recommendations based on what they like.

## Outline

To start, pick your favorite thing: movies, videos, TV shows, or video games. This is what the program should give recommendations for.

Our goal is to create a program that is interactive and helpful, so the program needs to do a couple of things:

1. Print out a list of genres that the user can pick from. For example, for video games, this could be

```rawtext
1) Action
2) Horror
3) Adventure
4) RPG
```

2. Ask which genre the user likes the most and store their input
3. Based on their choice, print out what you think they'd like!

## Example Output

Lines with `>` are input for the program.

```rawtext
1) Action
2) Horror
3) Adventure
4) RPG
> 3
It sounds like you'd enjoy Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Hollow Knight!
```

## More Ideas

- Add more genres for the user to choose from
- Ask users what kind of media they like (movies, videos, TV shows, or video games). Then, ask them their favorite genre and give them recommendations based on both the type of media they like _and_ their favorite genre.
- Add more recommendations for each genre
