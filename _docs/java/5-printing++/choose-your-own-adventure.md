title: Choose Your Own Adventure Game
order: 10
type: exercise

The core of a fun game is having choice, so let's make a game all about choice!

In a "choose your own adventure" game, you tell the user about a scenario, ask them what they want to do, and tell them what happened because of their choice.

Choices can result in good things (like discovering treasure) or in terrible things (like the player being so scared of a snake that they die).

The great thing about these types of games is that you can get a different experience each time you play if you make different decisions.

## Outline

1. Give the player a message describing who they are, what they're doing, and whatever else you want
2. List actions that the player can take and ask them which they want to do
3. Based on what they chose, print out a message to the player about what happened
4. Go back to step 1 and repeat this process until the player loses or wins

## Example Output

Again, lines with `>` are input for the program.

```rawtext
You are Indiana Jones, an adventurer exploring underground ruins, when you come across two buttons. Which do you press?
1) Button on the left
2) Button on the right
> 1
Pressing the button opened up strange door to a dark hallway. Do you...
1) Walk down the hallway
2) Do nothing
You slowly walk down the newly opened hallway, but suddenly a boulder comes out of the ceiling and crushes you!
Maybe run next time?
```

## More Ideas

Choose your own adventure games are all about choices, so add more choices for players to explore.
