Who needs friends when you can play rock paper scissors against your own program?

2. Take input from the user and store it as their move
3. Generate a random number as the computer's move
4. Using `if`, `else if`, `else` statements and the moves of the computer and player, print out who won!

## Example Output

Lines with `>` are input for the program.
