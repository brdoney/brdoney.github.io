We now know enough to create a basic calculator, so let's do just that!

## Outline

To make the calculator configurable, your calculator needs to do three things:

1. Store two values in variables
2. Do some mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) with the values of those two variables
3. Print out the result!

## Example Output

My two variables are `a`, which has a value of `2`, and `b`, which has a value of `3`. I chose to show addition, so my output is simply...

```rawtext

```
