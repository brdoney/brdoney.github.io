This is most important thing you will ever learn about computers.

Are you ready?

Here it is:

**_Computers are dumb_**

But the thing is, computers are really good at following instructions. So as computer programmers, we tell the dumb computers what to do so that they can _seem smart_.

**Computer code** is exactly how we tell the computer what to do. More specifically, "computer code" is the set of instructions that we tell the computer to do so that it can do what we want.

With computers, the order of your instructions also matters. After all, imagine if someone told you to go to the bathroom without lifting up the toilet lid first!

And just like when you talk to people, you need to speak the same language when you're talking to the computer. So when we write code, we have to use a language that the computer can understand, called a **programming language**.

There are LOTS of programming languages out there, but we'll be focusing on **Java**.
